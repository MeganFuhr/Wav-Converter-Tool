# Wav-Converter-Tool

This was something I quickly put together for an urgent need.  It converts a WAV to an MP3 file using ffmpeg.exe.  I leveraged 
Adamn Bertram's blog (https://4sysops.com/archives/how-to-create-an-open-file-folder-dialog-box-with-powershell/) and later used 
 (https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PS2EXE-GUI-Convert-e7cb69d5) PS2EXE-GUI to convert it to an executable.  This was never used.
